# This very basic shiny app takes our presidents birthplace
# leaflet map and allows us to filter which presidents are
# displayed by party affiliation.It also displays a data 
# table in another tab. And an interactive graph in the last
# tab.


# This begins the app
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Here we are reading in our birthplace data
  birthplace <- read.csv("birthplace.csv")
  #-------------------
  # Presidents Map
  #-------------------
  
  # Here is out map exactly as we made it in our last script,
  # except we are placing it in the object "map"

  # here we tell shiny to render the map in our app

  #--------------------
  # Reactive
  #--------------------  
  
  # This section of code defines a reactive that will allow us to filter
  # the data based on party affiliation
  # A reactive takes input from your ui and can store that information in 
  # memory so that it can be passed to render functions

    }

  #--------------------
  # Observe
  #--------------------
  
  # The observe function allows us to take the input from the reactive above
  # and edit pieces of the leaflet map when combined with leafletProxy()
  observe({
    mapdata <- filteredData()
    if (nrow(mapdata) != 0) {
      #if mapdata exists, then do the following:
      leafletProxy("map", data = mapdata) %>%
        clearMarkers() %>% # clear existing markers
        addCircleMarkers(
          # add new markers from this new data
          ~ Longitude,
          ~ Latitude,

            # keep the same popup info, but different dataset

# this reactive takes the input from CODE3 dropdown
  # and returns a data frame filtered by the selections of the drop down
  #Reactive expressions are a bit smarter than regular R functions. 
  #They cache their values and know when their values have become outdated. 
  # What does this mean? The first time that you run a reactive expression, 
  # the expression will save its result in your computerâ€™s memory. 
  # The next time you call the reactive expression, it can return 
  # this saved result without doing any computation 
  # (which will make your app faster).
  
  # The reactive expression will only return the saved result 
  # if it knows that the result is up-to-date. If the reactive
  # expression has learned that the result is obsolete 
  # (because a widget has changed), the expression will 
  # recalculate the result. It then returns the new result 
  # and saves a new copy. The reactive expression will use
  # this new copy until it too becomes out of date.
