# R-Basics

This repository contains my R Programming assignmnets from my university classes. Along with R, I have used R Markdown (starting from DATA 101) and R Shiny (starting from DATA 410) to publish my homework. I have given a overview of each course folder and the contents it contains:

* DATA 101: An introduction to data analytics in R on how to conduct exploratory data analysis. How to run basic R commands on a dataset.
* DATA 210: Learning intermediate data analytic concepts in R
* DATA 310: Exploring statisitcal techniques and concepts that need to be implemented in Data Analytics
* DATA 410: Using R Shiny to create websites that show various data visualisations (charts, spatial, etc.)

## Week 1: Measurement and Description

The process of statistical data analysis
1. Collecting Data for a Variable (weeks 1 & 3)
2. Describe the values of the veriable for the observed cases (week 1)
3. Make predictions about the likely values of the variable, for the un-observed cases (weeks 2-4)
4. Make predictions about the likely values of a variable, for the un-observed cases, given the variables we have observed/gathered for those cases (weeks 4-7)
5. Understand how the value of a variable is likely to change because another variable, or variables, changed (week 8)

Vocabulary for Statistics 
* Construct of Interest: A theoretical quantity or theme which describes a characteristic/outcome and is non-measurable. An example is self-esteem
* Unit: The object on which a construct of interest is defined
* Population: The collection of units over which a construct of interest is defined
* Sample: The subset of units in the population for which we observe data
* Variable: A measure of a specific construct of interest for all sampled units
    * Dependent Variable: A variable with an outcome that the data scientist is trying to understand
    * Independent Variable: A variable with an outcome that the data scientist takes as a given that relates to the dependent variable
* Data: A collection of variables for sampled units
* Measurement: The process of translating a construct of interest into a variable

Stages of measurement
1. Specifying the information to be collected (ex. writing a survey)
2. Sampling units, from the set of cases, to collect this information from (ex. assigning the units to take the survey)
3. Recording the information available about the sampled units (ex. recording the survey responses provided by the sampled units)
