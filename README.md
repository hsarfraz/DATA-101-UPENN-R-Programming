# R-Basics

This repository contains my R Programming assignmnets from my university classes. Along with R, I have used R Markdown (starting from DATA 101) and R Shiny (starting from DATA 410) to publish my homework. I have given a overview of each course folder and the contents it contains:

* DATA 101: An introduction to data analytics in R on how to conduct exploratory data analysis. How to run basic R commands on a dataset.
* DATA 210: Learning intermediate data analytic concepts in R
* DATA 310: Exploring statisitcal techniques and concepts that need to be implemented in Data Analytics
* DATA 410: Using R Shiny to create websites that show various data visualisations (charts, spatial, etc.)
